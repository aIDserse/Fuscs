# Fuscs- Fraction utility submachine in c#
C# calculator, provides all the 4 operations possible with fractions<br>
It reduces the fractions at their lowest terms, but this function is a little bit buggy, so pay attention!<br>
The reduction is under the "Reduce" methods if you'd like to see and try to fix something, and If you do contact me on Discord or Reddit!<br>
# License
The code is under WTFPL license. It's nearly like GPL, but better:))
