# Fuscs- Fraction utility submachine in c#
C# calculator, provides all the 4 operations possible with fractions<br>
It reduces the fractions at their lowest terms, but this function is a little bit buggy, so pay attention!<br>
The reduction is under the "Reduce" methods if you'd like to see and try to fix something, and If you do contact me on Discord or Reddit!<br>
By the way unless you don't do strange or very complicated operations it should work properly<br>
This version was built in Visual Studio Code 2019 community edition<br>
To build it you simply need a Visual studio copy and open the ".sln" file, and then run it<br>
If you do not want the source code there is a pre-compiled version under the "Releases" tag<br>
